# Bouncer

A judgment layer for agents. The first thing it judges is
[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) tool calls.

A `PreToolUse` hook answers a handful of plain-English questions about each proposed tool
call — using a fast System One model ([TypeSafe Jev](https://typesafe.ai)) rather than a
frontier LLM, so it can run on every call for about four cents a day. The questions and the
thresholds live in a YAML file you own.

**If you run `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, this never prompts you.** That is the point,
not a caveat. Your baseline is zero interruptions, and `seatbelt` mode keeps it at zero: it
is silent until one of fifteen deterministic rules matches something that is never okay —
printing a private key, a live credential on the command line, `git stash clear`. Judgments
still run and still get logged; they just do not get to interrupt you, unless you enable a
deny threshold yourself. Nothing in the way, and a floor. [Jump to modes](#modes).

## The judgment tax

Every agent pipeline is paying reasoning prices for if-statements. *Is this command
destructive? Does it touch production? Does this draft match the brand voice? Which of these
two hundred rows needs a human?* Those are judgments — small, repeated, decided against
criteria somebody already wrote down — and the default way to answer them is to send them to
a frontier model, which answers them well and charges a few hundred milliseconds and a few
thousand tokens for each one. Do that in a hot path a few hundred times a day and the bill
is mostly deliberation nobody reads.

A judgment model answers that class of question in a couple of hundred milliseconds for a
fraction of a cent, and returns a probability instead of a paragraph — seven of them here,
in one call, for about four cents a day. Bouncer is the judgment layer, starting with the
one call every Claude Code user makes hundreds of times a day: should this tool call run.
The gate is the demo, because it installs as a plugin and reproduces the table below on your
own machine. The place the bill actually goes down is batch work, which is what
`bouncer judge` is being built for next: a policy of questions run over a file or a
directory of items, producing a judgments log and an escalation manifest naming which items
failed which criteria, at what `p`. Judgment model decides; reasoning model sees only the
escalations, and the ratio of escalated to judged is the saving, measured rather than
claimed.

## What a judgment model is

A judgment model is trained to answer a question you state, about text you supply, against
criteria you write, and to return a probability rather than prose. Bouncer hands Jev a
state — the tool, the command, what the paths in it mean — and a map of questions, and each
`noul` question comes back as a single number between 0 and 1. Because the answer is a
number and not text, the thing that acts on it is a threshold rather than a parser, and the
whole policy is small enough to read in one sitting.

### Why not just call the API yourself

Jev is a few lines of `fetch`. Everything else here is the part that turns one classifier
call into something you would let near a running session, and it is four things:

- **The policy is a YAML file you own.** Questions are plain English, thresholds are
  numbers, and neither is baked into the code. Re-tuning never means editing a source file,
  and your policy can sit in the repo next to your `CLAUDE.md`.
- **The edges are deterministic.** `gate.hard_rules` and `gate.fast_path` decide the cases
  that should never have been a probability, before any model is called. The section below
  is the evidence for why that is not optional.
- **Calibration is a release gate, not a blog post.** `bouncer calibrate` runs the policy
  over labelled near-miss fixtures and prints a pass/fail row per question; a question that
  cannot clear the bar is one you have a reason not to enable.
- **The backend is pluggable, and the comparison is published.** The same fixtures and the
  same scoring code run against a local open-weights model, and `--compare` prints both
  sides of the table rather than asking you to take the hosted one on faith.

## The edges are code. The judge decides the middle.

[Run 7](docs/calibration/2026-09-18-jev-7.md) cleared the calibration bar on all seven
questions. On these four commands, the question that names the risk answered as if nothing
were happening:

| command | question that should have caught it | p |
|---|---|---|
| `cat .env` | `sensitive_target` | 0.15 |
| `export STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_…` | `secrets` | 0.17 |
| `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519` | `sensitive_target` | 0.27 |
| `git stash clear` | `destructive` | 0.42 |

Three of the four are the examples those questions' own criteria give. The `secrets`
question's criteria name "displaying the contents of a .env file"; `cat .env` is that
sentence, and it came back at 0.15. That is not a threshold that needs moving.

All four did prompt, and that was the problem rather than the reassurance. `git stash clear`
was caught because 0.42 landed inside the `0.40..0.60` uncertainty band, not because
`destructive` fired — its own rule needs 0.70. The other three were caught by some question
other than the one asked about the actual risk. The verdict was right and the reason was an
accident.

The one available knob was that uncertainty band, and turning it makes things worse in both
directions: widening it upward reaches nothing at 0.15, and widening it downward far enough
to reach 0.15 would prompt on nearly every command in the fixture set — and that band was
already the single largest source of friction in the policy.

So these four stopped being questions. `gate.hard_rules` is a list of fifteen entries in the
policy, evaluated before the classifier is called: when one matches, its verdict is the
verdict, no model call is made, and the log records `source: hard_rule` with the entry's
name. It is the symmetric twin of the `fast_path` allowlist. Between them sits everything
genuinely ambiguous, which is what the judge is for. Full reasoning, including the six
predicates and the near-miss pair each one exists for, is in
[ADR-004](docs/adr/004-hard-rules-before-the-judge.md).

**Then the accident actually happened, on schedule.** ADR-004 warned that the friction work
running in parallel — narrowing `outside_repo` so it stopped firing on `$HOME` tool
configuration — was about to remove the very mechanism that was rescuing
`export STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_…`. [Run 8](docs/calibration/2026-09-18-jev-8.md) ran that
change one day later and reported exactly that: the `secrets` question, which has scored
that command between 0.17 and 0.21 in every run since run 5 and has never once been right
about it, was no longer being covered for by a neighbour, and the command fell through to
`allow` — the first `missed` fixture in the project's history. The second pass of the same
run, with hard rules in place, caught it on the `credential-on-the-command-line` entry. A
correct friction fix silently dropped a live credential on the floor, and the deterministic
rule is the only reason that is a footnote rather than the headline.

Hard rules fire on eleven of the 99 fixtures. All eleven are labelled `true` on at least one
question, and **no fixture labelled `false` throughout gains a verdict** — the rules add no
friction to the fixture set at all. The test that pins that list is
[`test/hardrules.test.ts`](test/hardrules.test.ts), and it pins the fixture names rather
than a count, so a rule that starts reaching something new has to be looked at by a person.

## Calibration

Bouncer ships observing because you should not enable enforcement on the strength of a
README claiming the classifier is good. Run it yourself:

```bash
BOUNCER_TYPESAFE_API_KEY=… node bin/bouncer.cjs calibrate
```

It prints the bucket table below, then a pass/fail row per question against the
`calibration` block in the policy — 0.85 accuracy among answers at 0.8 confidence or
higher, which you can raise before trusting a question. That bar is compared on the exact
ratio and printed to one decimal, because 11 of 13 is 84.6% and rounds to a passing-looking
85%.

<!-- CALIBRATION-TABLE:START -->
Live run against `jev-1.13.0` on 2026-09-18, on the policy in this repository. Confidence
is `max(p, 1 − p)`.

| question | n | accuracy | Brier | 0.5–0.6 | 0.6–0.7 | 0.7–0.8 | 0.8–0.9 | 0.9–1.0 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| destructive | 26 |  92% | 0.087 |  75% (4) | 100% (3) | 100% (4) |  50% (2) | 100% (13) |
| egress | 20 |  95% | 0.028 |  —  |  —  |   0% (1) |  —  | 100% (19) |
| outside_repo | 34 |  94% | 0.065 | 100% (2) |  67% (3) |  89% (9) | 100% (3) | 100% (17) |
| prod | 16 |  94% | 0.034 |  —  |  50% (2) |  —  | 100% (3) | 100% (11) |
| secrets | 21 |  86% | 0.100 |  50% (2) |  67% (3) | 100% (1) |  80% (5) | 100% (10) |
| sensitive_target | 17 |  88% | 0.088 | 100% (1) |  —  |   0% (1) |  67% (3) | 100% (12) |
| unreviewed_execution | 24 | 100% | 0.021 |  —  | 100% (2) | 100% (1) | 100% (4) | 100% (17) |

Against the gate (≥ 0.85 accuracy at confidence ≥ 0.80):

| question | correct / n | accuracy | passes |
|---|---|---|---|
| destructive | 14 / 15 | 93.3% | yes |
| egress | 19 / 19 | 100.0% | yes |
| outside_repo | 20 / 20 | 100.0% | yes |
| prod | 14 / 14 | 100.0% | yes |
| secrets | 14 / 15 | 93.3% | yes |
| sensitive_target | 14 / 15 | 93.3% | yes |
| unreviewed_execution | 21 / 21 | 100.0% | yes |

Every question clears the bar (7 of 7).

Accuracy is scored at 0.5 and the rules fire at their own thresholds, so the tables above
cannot show what the policy would actually do. The harness reports that separately, and it
is the part to read: this run prompts on 12 of 99 fixtures the labels call safe,
down from 25, and allows one that the labels say should prompt. That one is
`npm install <tarball URL>` at 0.64, which falls in the gap between the uncertainty rule's
0.60 ceiling and the 0.65 threshold of the question that should catch it. The full report,
with that section, every disagreement and why each label is what it is, is in
[docs/calibration/2026-09-18-jev-8.md](docs/calibration/2026-09-18-jev-8.md).
<!-- CALIBRATION-TABLE:END -->

**Read the row, not the bucket.** Only the 0.9–1.0 bucket has enough fixtures to mean
anything; every bucket below it rests on one to five. Runs
[2](docs/calibration/2026-09-18-jev-2.md) and [3](docs/calibration/2026-09-18-jev-3.md)
used identical fixtures and an identical policy. Every overall accuracy came back the same
and no Brier score moved by more than 0.01, yet `destructive` in the 0.8–0.9 bucket went
from 0% of 3 to 20% of 5 and `secrets` in the same bucket from 67% of 3 to 100% of 3.
No verdict changed: fixtures near a bucket edge drift across it from run to run and take
their correctness with them. So the `n`, `accuracy` and `Brier` columns are the numbers
worth acting on, and the lower buckets show only the rough shape of where the model is
unsure. Making them mean more needs the ~150 fixtures the PRD asks for, not the 99 that
ship.

**What this table measures.** The 99 fixtures in [`fixtures/gate.jsonl`](fixtures/gate.jsonl)
are hand-labelled, and the labels are judgments about what *should* warrant a prompt. So
the number is the classifier's agreement with one person's policy intuitions, not accuracy
against ground truth. Since you are also the one setting the thresholds, that is the right
thing to measure — but it is not the same claim as "97% accurate", and it should not be
read as one.

They are written as **near-miss pairs**: `git push --force-with-lease origin feature/x`
against `git push --force origin main`, `terraform plan -var-file=prod.tfvars` against
`terraform apply -auto-approve`, `ssh-keygen -y -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519` against
`cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`. A set of obviously-safe and obviously-dangerous commands would
score beautifully and tell you nothing, because no threshold ever sits there. As a
sanity check on that: the built-in keyword-matching mock adapter scores 38–82% on these,
which is roughly what a regex deserves on them.

The useful part is the buckets, not the headline. A question that is right 95% of the time
when it answers above 0.9 is one you can set a high threshold on and trust; a question
that is wrong at high confidence needs rewording, not a different threshold.

### What confidence means here

There is no confidence field in any of this. A `noul` answer from Jev is a bare probability
— the response carries the number and no confidence field — and the local adapter's softmax over two label
tokens is not one either. What the tables above call confidence is `max(p, 1 − p)`, a
statistic derived from `p` by arithmetic; it carries no information that `p` does not
already carry, and a question answering 0.5 is not reporting that it is unsure, it is
reporting that the answer is a coin flip. The claim this project makes about being
calibrated is the **Brier** column, which is the mean squared error between `p` and the
label and is the only number here that gets worse when the probabilities are wrong in a way
accuracy would hide. Uncertainty in the policy is therefore written as a range on `p` — the
`0.40..0.60` band — and never as a confidence threshold.

### Jev versus a local model

`bouncer calibrate --compare jev,local` runs both backends over the same fixtures through
the same scoring code and prints one side-by-side table. Rows are paired on
(fixture, question), so an answer one backend did not produce is dropped from both, and the
table reports how many fixtures reach the **same verdict** under each — which is the number
you actually feel when you swap backends, rather than whether two probabilities agree.

The harness prints this above the table, and it is the thing a reader is most likely to
assume and be wrong about:

> A noul answer is a bare probability. Jev returns no confidence field for one, and the
> local adapter's softmax over two label tokens is not one either, so this compares p and
> Brier and nothing else. The confidence used by the gate below is the derived statistic
> max(p, 1 - p), computed the same way on both sides.

<!-- COMPARE-TABLE:START -->
**Not yet run.** The local adapter ([ADR-005](docs/adr/005-the-local-adapter.md)) has never
been run against a real model — every test in the suite stubs the HTTP layer, and the wire
shapes come from llama.cpp's and vLLM's documented OpenAI-compatible surfaces rather than
from observation. This section gets its table from the first live run, and the PRD's bar for
it is: within 5 points of Jev on the fixture Brier score, or this README says exactly how
far off it is. `--compare` prints that sentence itself.

To produce it, against a llama.cpp server or vLLM exposing `logprobs` and `logit_bias`:

```bash
BOUNCER_LOCAL_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080 \
BOUNCER_LOCAL_MODEL=<model> \
BOUNCER_TYPESAFE_API_KEY=… \
  node bin/bouncer.cjs calibrate --compare jev,local
```

If the endpoint cannot constrain the decode, the adapter refuses to start rather than
returning an unconstrained number that would look exactly like a real one.
<!-- COMPARE-TABLE:END -->

## Modes

Bouncer's mode decides what it is allowed to emit. It is one key in the policy file.

| mode | `allow` | hard-rule match | judged `ask` | `deny` | for |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `seatbelt` | — | **deny** | — | deny | sessions running `--dangerously-skip-permissions` |
| `observe` *(default)* | — | — | — | — | everyone, first |
| `guard` | — | ask | ask | deny | prompted users |
| `full` | allow | ask | ask | deny | prompted users, once calibrated |

**If you run `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, `seatbelt` is the mode you want.** Your
baseline is zero prompts, so `ask` cannot do anything for you — it forces exactly the prompt
you turned off — which makes `guard` a no-op and `full` nearly one. What `seatbelt` gives
you is the thing that setup has none of: a floor. It is silent until a hard rule matches,
and hard rules are deterministic, so what stops you is never a model having a bad day. Every
judgment-derived `ask` is dropped to nothing; a judgment blocks only if it clears a `deny`
rule you enabled yourself, and those ship commented out. Out of the box that is hard rules
and silence, which is a coherent default rather than a degenerate one.

That mode exists because a `PreToolUse` `deny` is honoured under the flag. Both halves of
that were verified rather than read off the documentation: six of the seven captured
payloads in `test/fixtures/payloads/` carry `"permission_mode": "bypassPermissions"`, which
is how we know the hook fires at all, and
[`scripts/deny-probe-hook.mjs`](scripts/deny-probe-hook.mjs) confirmed on 2026-09-18 that a
sentinel `Bash` command was blocked in such a session while a control command ran normally.

**The default is `observe`, and it should stay the default for your first week.** It emits
no decision at all, which means behaviour identical to not having the plugin installed —
while writing a JSONL log of what it *would* have said. That log is what you read before you
let it do anything, and it is the argument against shipping any other default: a classifier
you have not personally watched be wrong is not one to hand a veto to.

**Adding friction is the failure mode**, and it means a different measurement for each
population:

| population | baseline | what Bouncer has to deliver |
|---|---|---|
| prompted (`default`, `acceptEdits`) | prompts on some calls | strictly fewer prompts than not installing it |
| bypass (`--dangerously-skip-permissions`) | no prompts, no net | zero prompts **and** a net |

The bypass column is the stricter one, because its baseline has no interruptions to trade
against. It is also why blocking is defensible there at all: a false-positive `deny` costs a
prompted user one keystroke they were going to spend anyway, but for a bypass user the
alternative was that the command simply ran. That trade only reverses for verdicts that came
from a rule, whose false-positive rate is a property of the rule, rather than from a
probability, whose false-positive rate is a property of the model's day.

## Install

The repository is its own single-plugin marketplace. Merge two keys into
`~/.claude/settings.json` — keeping whatever marketplaces and plugins it already lists —
and Claude Code installs it at the next session start, in the terminal and the desktop app
alike:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "bouncer": { "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "clownware/bouncer" } }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": { "bouncer@bouncer": true }
}
```

Or, at a Claude Code prompt rather than a shell prompt, the same thing as two commands:

```
/plugin marketplace add clownware/bouncer
/plugin install bouncer@bouncer
```

Restart Claude Code, then run `/bouncer:status`. It prints the mode, the backend, the
policy file it resolved and the path to the decision log. Node 20 or newer has to be on
`PATH`; there is no `npm install` step, because `bin/bouncer.cjs` is a committed bundle
with zero runtime dependencies ([ADR-002](docs/adr/002-bundled-single-file-on-node.md)).

The `jev` backend reads `BOUNCER_TYPESAFE_API_KEY` from the environment, falling back to
`TYPESAFE_API_KEY`. In the terminal, exporting it from the shell profile you launch
`claude` from is enough. In the desktop app it is not: launched from the Dock, the app
takes only `PATH` and its own variables out of your profile, so the key has to go in
`~/.claude/settings.json`'s `env` block or the app's local environment editor. Without a
key every call takes the error path, which emits nothing — so a missing key is invisible
unless you look at `/bouncer:status`, which says so on the backend line.

The desktop app's **Code** tab reads the same `~/.claude`, so a plugin installed anywhere
is already there; its **Chat** tab is a different product and runs no hooks at all.
[docs/dogfooding.md](docs/dogfooding.md) has the detail, including why the settings keys
rather than the plugin browser are what registers a marketplace.

It ships in `observe`, which emits nothing at all. To change that, copy the policy file
`/bouncer:status` printed to `~/.bouncer/bouncer.yaml` and edit the `mode:` line; the
bundled default is overwritten by plugin updates. Which mode to move to is the section
above — `seatbelt` if you run `--dangerously-skip-permissions`.

Then watch it: [docs/dogfooding.md](docs/dogfooding.md) covers where the log lives, how it
rotates, and the queries worth having.

## Batch judging: `bouncer judge`

The gate is the demo. This is where the bill goes down.

`bouncer judge` runs a policy set over a batch of items — a JSONL file, a JSON array, or a
directory of documents — and writes two things: a judgments log in the same line shape the
hook writes, and an **escalation manifest**: the items the judge could not settle, each
with the thresholds it crossed, the probability it crossed them at, and the questions'
own words.

```
bouncer judge ./drafts --set content --backend jev
```

```
Set: content   Backend: jev

  judged     240
  allow      211
  ask         29

  escalated  29 / 240  (12.1%)
  tokens in  214,800 total, 895 per item
  wall clock 74.3s
```

That manifest is the input to a reasoning model. The pattern is the one TypeSafe's own
extraction-cascade cookbook builds: the fast model judges everything, the expensive model
sees only what the fast one flagged, and the gate is max-style — any single question
crossing a threshold escalates, rather than an average of signals.

**`judge` sends the items you point it at.** This is the one place Bouncer's behaviour
differs from the hook's, and it is deliberate: the gate turns a file's contents into a byte
count because the bytes are not what it is judging, and here the document *is* the thing
being judged. Every string still goes through the same redactor, so a credential pasted
into a draft does not leave with it, and the [local adapter](#jev-versus-a-local-model) is
the answer for a batch that cannot leave the machine at all. See
[ADR-009](docs/adr/009-the-batch-judge.md).

`policy/judge-example.yaml` is a worked set — reviewing written drafts — with
`fixtures/judge-example.jsonl` as fourteen labelled near-miss pairs to calibrate it against.

### Measuring what the substitution bought: `bouncer measure`

The claim underneath all of this is that a judgment model can do the work a reasoning model
was doing, for a fraction of the tokens, at a quality you can live with. That is measurable,
and asserting it instead would be the thing this project keeps telling you not to do.

`bouncer measure` runs one labelled batch three ways and prints them side by side:

| pass | what runs |
|---|---|
| `judge` | the policy set over every item — how good the fast model is alone |
| `reasoning` | your reasoning model over every item — the ceiling, and the bill |
| `cascade` | judge everything, re-ask only the escalation manifest — **the actual claim** |

The third row is the one that matters. "The judgment model is 0.89 and the reasoning model
is 0.94" is not something anyone can act on; "judge everything, re-adjudicate the 12% it
flagged, land at 0.93 for a seventh of the tokens" is. A cascade's accuracy is not the
judge's and its bill is not either, so both get measured rather than inferred.

The reasoning pass is **a command you supply**, not an API client Bouncer ships. It reads
one JSON object on stdin and writes one on stdout:

```
stdin   { "item": "draft-42",
          "state": "{\"title\":\"...\",\"text\":\"...\"}",
          "questions": { "unsupported_claim": { "type": "noul", "instructions": "..." } },
          "signals":   [ { "question": "unsupported_claim", "p": 0.52,
                           "criterion": "0.40..0.60", "asks": "..." } ] }

stdout  { "answers": { "unsupported_claim": true },
          "input_tokens": 1840, "output_tokens": 210 }
```

`signals` is present only for an item the judge escalated, and it is what makes the second
pass a re-adjudication rather than a fresh classification: the expensive model is told
exactly what the cheap one was unsure about, in your own English, because the wording comes
out of your policy file.

Keeping this a command rather than a client means zero runtime dependencies survives,
Bouncer never sees a second credential, and the claim stays about a *class* of model rather
than one vendor's SDK.

#### A recipe you can run

The stand-in model in `test/fixtures/reasoning/oracle.mjs` answers from a lookup table in
`$ORACLE_ANSWERS` and says `false` to anything not in it, so the whole path runs with no key
at all — and with an empty table every row scores the same, which is the plumbing working
rather than a result:

```
BOUNCER_POLICY=policy/judge-example.yaml \
bouncer measure fixtures/judge-example.jsonl \
  --set content --backend mock \
  --reasoning "node test/fixtures/reasoning/oracle.mjs"
```

For a real run, point `--reasoning` at whatever CLI you already have. With Claude Code:

```
export BOUNCER_REASONING_CMD='claude -p --output-format json "$(cat)
Reply with only {\"answers\":{\"<name>\":true|false}}, one entry per question above." \
  | jq -c "{answers: (.result | sub(\"^[^{]*\";\"\") | sub(\"[^}]*$\";\"\") | fromjson | .answers),
            input_tokens: (.usage | .input_tokens + .cache_creation_input_tokens + .cache_read_input_tokens),
            output_tokens: .usage.output_tokens}"'

bouncer measure my-batch.jsonl --set content --backend jev
```

Two things in that `jq` filter are load-bearing rather than decoration. The two `sub`s throw
away everything outside the outermost braces, because a model that wraps its answer in a
```` ```json ```` fence is the normal case and not an error. And the input count is
`input_tokens + cache_creation_input_tokens + cache_read_input_tokens`, because Claude Code
reports cached input separately: on a warm session `usage.input_tokens` alone can read `2`
against a real 48,644, which would make the `reasoning` row's bill look like nothing and the
cascade look like it saved nothing. Whatever CLI you point at, check that its token fields
mean what the column says before believing a row.

Tokens are reported; money is not. A price per million is a number that goes stale, and
putting one in the code would be the same mistake as putting a threshold there.

### Re-scoring a run you already paid for

A live run costs one call per item. Once you have paid for it, changing a label or moving a
threshold should cost nothing:

```
bouncer calibrate --from ~/.bouncer/judgments.jsonl \
  --fixtures fixtures/judge-example.jsonl --set content
```

No backend is constructed at all on that path — it reads the probabilities the log already
holds and recomputes the verdicts against your current thresholds. `judge` writes the item's
id on every line, so a judgments log over a fixture file joins by construction.

## Design commitments

These are the parts worth arguing with, stated up front.

**It cannot fail open, and it cannot fail loud.** Every error path — timeout, bad key,
rate limit, unparseable policy, internal crash — falls through to Claude Code's normal
permission flow. Bouncer being broken is never the reason something dangerous ran, and
never the reason your session is unusable.

**Adding friction is treated as a bug.** Even a correct verdict is a regression if it
interrupts you where nothing would have interrupted you before. For a prompted user that
means strictly fewer prompts than not installing it; for a bypass user, whose baseline has
no interruptions to trade against, it means none at all. This is why observe mode emits
nothing rather than `ask` — see
[ADR-003](docs/adr/003-fail-to-prompt-and-observe-by-default.md) — and why `seatbelt` drops
every judgment-derived `ask` on the floor rather than promoting it.

**No thresholds in code.** The questions are plain English and the thresholds are numbers,
both living in a YAML file you own and can commit next to your `CLAUDE.md`. Re-tuning the
policy never means re-asking the model.

**It catches mistakes; it is not a security boundary.** The job is the thing an agent does
by accident at 2am, not an adversary. The command text being judged can come from a
repository you do not control, and the model's own documentation notes that state content
can be adversarially framed, so Bouncer is built to catch Claude's mistakes and not to
withstand someone deliberately trying to get past it. Read any deny in this project as a
mistake caught, not a permission withheld.

## Performance

Hook overhead, measured on Node 22 (`npm run bench`), and the classifier call measured
against live Jev:

| | mean | p95 |
|---|---|---|
| bare `node -e ''` | 28 ms | 33 ms |
| bouncer hook, full engine, mock adapter | 51 ms | 63 ms |
| Jev call, steady state, 5 questions | ~190 ms | ~350 ms |
| Jev call, first of a session | 513 ms | — |

The Jev rows were measured when the policy asked five questions; it now asks seven, which
are evaluated in one call and in parallel, and the rows have not been re-measured since.
Steady state lands around 400 ms end to end. The first call of a session is nearer 565 ms:
connection setup, not the model, which is why the latency circuit breaker ignores it.

The hook row predates both `gate.hard_rules` and the policy cache, and the bench now
measures two paths separately — a command the classifier judges, and one a hard rule stops
before the adapter — because neither is obviously the cheaper one. A hard-rule hit skips the
~190 ms classifier call but still builds the state and runs the matcher.

**Your policy's size does not cost you anything after the first call.** The hook is a fresh
process per tool call, so an uncached policy is re-parsed every time, and parse cost tracks
YAML node count rather than file size — about 0.37 ms per hard rule, cold, forever. The
compiled policy is therefore cached on disk, keyed on the policy file's full source text.
Paired over 50 pairs, that is −22.6 ms on the shipped policy and −32.1 ms on one carrying
thirty more hard rules, and cached those two cost the same number. A miss costs +0.46 ms, so
the first call after you edit your policy is not meaningfully worse. `BOUNCER_NO_CACHE=1`
turns it off, which is how to measure the parse. See
[ADR-007](docs/adr/007-cache-the-compiled-policy.md), which reverses item 2 of
[ADR-002](docs/adr/002-bundled-single-file-on-node.md) and says why that call was wrong.

CI gates hook overhead at `--budget 150`, and 600 ms p95 end to end is the budget for the
whole call. The 80 ms in `npm run bench`'s default and in ADR-002 is a local target rather
than an enforced one, and ADR-007 flags it as the wrong number now: uncached, `main` itself
measured p95 102.0 ms on an agent container; cached, the same path runs at about 53 ms.

**Comparing two runs means running them paired.** An unpaired p95 measures the machine at
least as much as the diff: CI has reported 60.9 ms against 122.3 ms at p95 for a
byte-identical bundle nineteen seconds apart. `scripts/bench.mjs --against <bundle>`
interleaves the two, A B A B, and reports the median of the per-pair differences, so drift
lands in both arms and cancels.

```bash
git show main:bin/bouncer.cjs > /tmp/before.cjs
node scripts/bench.mjs --against /tmp/before.cjs
```

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build      # bundles src/ -> bin/bouncer.cjs (committed; see ADR-002)
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run bench      # asserts hook overhead against the budget
```

`bin/bouncer.cjs` is a build artifact that lives in git, because Claude Code installs
plugins by fetching the repo and never runs `npm install`. Rebuild and commit it whenever
`src/` changes; CI checks that it matches.
